Number theory Suff(very briefly,only main)

First of all we have a good imgination of the mod operation (see modOperation.txt), frequently denoted as - %.
Some notions:
1) % mod operatoin
2) a % b = a - floor(a / b) = r, where r is the remainder of the division.
3) -a % b = (a + b * k) - floor ((a + b * k) / b) any nums that a + b * k >= 0
4) Z = {...,-1,0,1,..} integer set
5) N = {0,1,...} natural number set
6) d | a means that a = k * d and a % d == 0 (d divides a)
7) Prime number have a denotation 'p' (usually), so if num 'a' only divisors are the 1 and 'a' then 'a' is a prime.
First primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ...
So if num have more than two trivial divisors then nums as composite numbers is called.
8) The equivalence class modulo n, is set of numbers a + kn where k belongs to Z. For example a = 2, n = 3 set is {...-4,-1,2,5,8,...}
9) So followed by 8-item we can say that if 'b' belong to set a + kn then b ? a (% n) or b % n = a % n
