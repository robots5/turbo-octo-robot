Modulo operation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)

In the C++ its denotes as operation "%".
So this operation take remain part of division.
For example 10 % 3 == 1, since 9 is the bigger num near (less or equal) to 10, hence 1 == 10 - 9

Main proporties of mod (%):

1. (a * b) % m == (a % m * b % m) % m

2. (a + b) % m == (a % m + a % m) % m

3. (a ^ b) % m == (a % m ^ b % (m - 1)) % m if m is a prime number. Problem for that with tutorial:https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/nov-2020-editorial-power-of-numbers
Its follows from Fermat's little theorem, see Generalizations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem)
else you can use this fact
(a ^ b) % m = F(a,b) = if (b % 2 == 0) (F(a,b/2) * a % m * a % m) else (F(a,b - 1) * a) % m that work for O(log b).

4. (a / b ) %m == (a * (b^-1)) % m where b^-1 can be find by solving this one (b^-1) === 1 (% m). Pay attention b^-1 is not 1/b!!!
Also (b^-1) is called as invertible elemnt or a unit in a ring for b (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(ring_theory))
It can be solved by GCDE (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm)
