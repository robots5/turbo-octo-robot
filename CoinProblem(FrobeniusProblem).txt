Frobenius Numbers
Its the LARGEST value that can't be obtain by given set of interger number.
For example set is {5,4} and largest num is 7 since (8 can be obtain by 4 + 4, 9 = 4 + 5)
For solving this problem need to transform into shortest path problem (http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v12i1r27/pdf)
